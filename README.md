# Todo Prototype
Our designer is great! They've created our todo app in HTML and CSS, wrapped with Create React App.

Now we just need to turn it into a working app.

**Starting Features**
1. Update list from hardcode todos to todos kept in react state
2. Ability to show and change if a todo is completed or not
3. Ability to delete a todo
4. Show count of how many todos are left
5. Ability to create a new todo
6. A filter to show All / Active / Completed todos
7. Get todos from the REST endpoint `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`
8. Create a search that filters todos
9. Add a date & time picker (from an external UI lib) and include a datetime for each todo
10. Give priorities to do, and sort sorting by alpha or priotity.

**Data Features**
1. Add the Graph component - and update to real numbers
